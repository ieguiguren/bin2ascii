#bin2ascii

You know when geek people thinks they are geeker for writing 11001101 in stead of readable characters? This script converts such silly text to readable. Will you be the only one in such group who will not know what are they saying?

Then you see "geeker" people are missing letters in their "edge killing fashion geekish writing".
